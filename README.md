# ngp-form-scraper
Scrapes NGP forms to provide everything you need to create a custom form

This project is currently under development and isn't ready to be used by anyone. My goal is to create an Angular app with a Node/Express backend that will accept any NGP form url you give it and will return all the fields you will need to scrape that form.

NGP recently changed their API and made it much harder to scrape their forms to create your own interface that matches the design of your website. This app will get around that.
